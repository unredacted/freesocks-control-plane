# One-shot deployer: pushes the Convex functions, sets the deployment env, and
# seeds, all inside the compose stack (no host Bun, no manual admin-key copy).
# It uses the convex CLI from the repo lockfile and reads the admin key from the
# shared volume the `keygen` service writes. See docs/beta-deploy.md.
